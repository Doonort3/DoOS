# DooOS
Some DOS I created on Cosmos OS

DooOS is built on Cosmos OS, uses .net, X#, IL2CPU.
Created similar to SHELL

## Installing
1) Download the '**main**' folder - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VHwVbzSI0HNX8_eSkdSuhPUwKmgSNC8u?usp=sharing **Compiled ISO image will be output with delays**
2) After you download the **zip archive**, you **unzip** it anywhere.
   **It is important that the folders 'cosmos' and 'Oska' are in the same directory!**
3) Run **VMware** (Virtual Box is not stable) - https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html
4) Player > file > open. Go to the 'Oska' folder and **select the virtual machine image**.
5) Start it up and in the popup window you select **"I copied it"** and you're done!
